## About Project

Find My Resource is a fully responsive web app to help users navigate the many helpful resources that have been added to the Chingu platform.

It makes learning easier by giving users the ability to search for resource based on title or by topics that interest them.

## How it works

Easily find resources that would be of interest to you by searching through the Chingu resources by typing
the full title of the resource if you know exactly what you are looking for, or you can choose to search
for resource for topics that interest you by using the available tags.

The data is paginated so that the resources are displayed in manageable chunks.
